"""Generate lyrics_pipeline/english_lexicon.py from the project transliterator.

The corpus transliteration model phonetically Devanagari-izes English words
(``this`` -> ``थिस``). This script builds two derived resources:

* ``ENGLISH_WORDS``: roman English tokens the transliteration gate must leave
  untouched (plus contraction suffixes handled contextually).
* ``ENGLISH_DEVANAGARI_FORMS`` / ``METADATA_DEVANAGARI_FORMS``: the model's own
  Devanagari renderings of English words, used to detect transliterated
  English prose and site metadata in already-transliterated text.

Words that collide with common romanized Nepali/Hindi tokens (``man`` -> मन,
``ma`` -> म, ``sun`` -> सुन, ...) are excluded from the gate, and Devanagari
forms that collide with common Nepali words (``आई`` from ``i``, ``हेरे`` from
``here``, ...) are excluded from detection.
